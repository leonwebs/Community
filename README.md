## Communities of interest for congressional redistricting in Colorado
---
Colorado's
redistricting commission is entrusted with the authority to draw
Congressional district boundaries.  Among its considerations must be 
>... communities of interest, including ethnic, cultural, economic,
>trade area, geographic, and demographic factors, shall be preserved
>within a single district wherever possible. " 
[Redistricting provisions](https://www.colorado.gov/pacific/cga-redistrict/constitutional-provisions)

Preservation of communities of interest is not quantitatively defined.
This code provides a way for interest groups to quantitatively evaluate 
how well the boundaries provided by
the commission preserve communities and decide whether a challenge is
warranted.

These Jupyter notebooks have plots of districts and preliminary analysis.
