## Communities of interest for congressional redistricting in Colorado
--
This is an entry into the data analysis track.  Colorado's
redistricting commission is entrusted with the authority to draw
Congressional district boundaries.  Among its considerations must be 
>... communities of interest, including ethnic, cultural, economic,
>trade area, geographic, and demographic factors, shall be preserved
>within a single district wherever possible. "

Preservation of communities of interest is not quantitatively defined.
This code provides a way for interest groups, the business desicion
makers, to quantitatively evaluate how well the boundaries provided by
the commission preserve communities and decide whether a challenge is
warranted.
